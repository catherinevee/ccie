## Key Components
1. **Spine Switches**
   - Role: Core of the network, responsible for high-speed data transfer between leaf switches.
   - Configuration: Supports EVPN-VXLAN for overlay networking.

2. **Leaf Switches**
   - Role: Connects end devices and provides access to the network.
   - Configuration: Implements VLANs and handles traffic from connected devices.

3. **Border Routers**
   - Role: Connects the internal network to external networks, including the internet.
   - Configuration: Manages routing policies and security features.

4. **Core Routers**
   - Role: Provides high-capacity routing capabilities for MPLS and other core services.
   - Configuration: Supports MPLS L3VPN for service provider environments.

## Design Considerations
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale horizontally by adding more spine and leaf switches as needed.
- **Redundancy**: Implementing dual-homed connections and link aggregation to ensure high availability.
- **Performance**: Utilizing high-speed interfaces and optimized routing protocols to minimize latency.
- **Security**: Incorporating firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) to protect sensitive data.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a solid foundation for [Company Name]'s network, ensuring it meets current and future demands while maintaining high performance and security standards. Further details on specific configurations can be found in the respective configuration files.
