# zwu CCIE Network Quick Start Guide

**IMPORTANT**: This is a **documentation-only repository**. It provides reference architecture, design patterns, and configuration examples for CCIE-level network deployments. The folder structure described in the README represents what a complete implementation should contain.

## Using This Documentation

### For Learning & Study
1. Review the architecture documentation in `documentation/design/`
2. Study configuration examples in `documentation/design/fabric_reference.md`
3. Understand topology designs in the design diagrams
4. Practice with vendor-specific configurations

### For Implementation Planning
1. Use `documentation/design/technology_comparison.md` to choose appropriate technologies
2. Review `documentation/validation_checklists.md` for deployment planning
3. Study `documentation/troubleshooting/` for common issues
4. Adapt configuration examples for your environment

### Key Documentation
- **Architecture Overview**: `docs/architecture_overview.md`
- **Technology Reference**: `documentation/design/fabric_reference.md`
- **Technology Comparison**: `documentation/design/technology_comparison.md`
- **Troubleshooting**: `documentation/troubleshooting/evpn_vxlan_troubleshooting.md`
- **Validation Checklists**: `documentation/validation_checklists.md`

### What a Complete Implementation Would Include
If you were to build a full network automation project based on this documentation, you would need:
- `configs/`: Device-specific configuration files
- `templates/`: Jinja2 templates for config generation
- `variables/`: YAML files with device/service variables
- `scripts/`: Python automation scripts
- `ansible/`: Ansible playbooks for deployment
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `tools/`: Validation and compliance utilities

For detailed reference architecture and best practices, see `documentation/design/`.
