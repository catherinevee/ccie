# Deployment Instructions

## Overview
This document provides detailed instructions for deploying the network configuration as part of the CCIE project. It outlines the steps necessary to ensure a successful deployment, including pre-deployment checks, deployment procedures, and post-deployment validation.

## Pre-Deployment Checks
1. **Review Configuration Files**: Ensure that all configuration files in the `configs` directory are complete and validated.
2. **Check Dependencies**: Verify that all required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` are installed.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Backup Existing Configurations**: Before deploying new configurations, back up the current device configurations.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/backup_configs.yml
   ```

## Deployment Procedure
1. **Deploy the Network Fabric**: Use the Ansible playbook to deploy the network configurations.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/deploy_fabric.yml
   ```
2. **Monitor Deployment**: Watch the output for any errors or warnings during the deployment process. Ensure that all tasks complete successfully.

## Post-Deployment Validation
1. **Validate Configurations**: Run the validation script to check that the configurations have been applied correctly.
   ```bash
   python scripts/deploy/validate.py
   ```
2. **Perform Connectivity Tests**: Execute integration tests to confirm that all devices are reachable and functioning as expected.
   ```bash
   python tests/integration/test_connectivity.py
   ```
3. **Document Results**: Record the results of the validation and testing in the `documentation/testing/test_results.md` file.

## Rollback Procedures
In case of deployment failure, follow these steps to revert to the previous configuration:
1. **Rollback Configuration**: Use the rollback playbook to restore the previous configurations.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/rollback.yml
   ```
2. **Re-validate Configurations**: After rollback, validate the configurations again to ensure the network is stable.

## Conclusion
Following these deployment instructions will help ensure a smooth and successful deployment of the network configurations. Always refer to the troubleshooting document if issues arise during the deployment process.
