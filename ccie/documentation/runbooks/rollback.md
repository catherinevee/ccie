# Rollback Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines the rollback procedures to be followed in the event of a deployment failure. It is crucial to ensure that the network can be restored to a stable state quickly and efficiently.

## Rollback Steps

1. **Identify the Failure**
   - Review logs and error messages from the deployment process.
   - Determine the specific device(s) and configuration(s) that failed.

2. **Notify Stakeholders**
   - Inform relevant team members and stakeholders about the deployment failure.
   - Provide details on the affected services and expected downtime.

3. **Initiate Rollback**
   - Use the rollback script located at `scripts/deploy/rollback.py` to revert to the last known good configuration.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```
     python scripts/deploy/rollback.py
     ```

4. **Verify Rollback**
   - After executing the rollback, validate the configurations on the affected devices.
   - Use the validation scripts located in `scripts/deploy/validate.py` to ensure that the configurations are correct and operational.

5. **Monitor Network Stability**
   - Monitor the network for any anomalies or issues post-rollback.
   - Ensure that all services are functioning as expected.

6. **Document the Incident**
   - Record the details of the deployment failure and the rollback process in the CHANGELOG.md file.
   - Include lessons learned and any changes to the deployment process to prevent future occurrences.

## Conclusion
Following these rollback procedures will help ensure that the network can be restored to a stable state in the event of a deployment failure, minimizing downtime and impact on services.
