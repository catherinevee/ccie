# Troubleshooting Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides troubleshooting guidelines for network configurations and operations within the CCIE project. It aims to assist network engineers in diagnosing and resolving common issues encountered in the network.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Connectivity Issues
- **Symptom**: Devices cannot communicate with each other.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Verify physical connections and ensure cables are properly connected.
  - Check interface status using `show ip interface brief` (Cisco) or `show interfaces` (Juniper).
  - Ensure correct IP addressing and subnetting.
  - Use `ping` to test connectivity between devices.

### 2. Configuration Errors
- **Symptom**: Device fails to apply configuration changes.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Review the configuration syntax for errors.
  - Check for missing or incorrect commands in the configuration.
  - Use `show running-config` to verify the current configuration.
  - Roll back to the last known good configuration if necessary.

### 3. Routing Issues
- **Symptom**: Routes are not being advertised or learned.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Verify routing protocol configurations (e.g., OSPF, BGP).
  - Check neighbor relationships using `show ip ospf neighbor` or `show bgp summary`.
  - Ensure that route filters or policies are not blocking routes.
  - Use `traceroute` to identify where packets are being dropped.

### 4. Performance Problems
- **Symptom**: Network latency or packet loss.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Monitor interface statistics for errors or drops using `show interfaces`.
  - Check for bandwidth saturation on links.
  - Use tools like `iperf` to measure throughput between devices.
  - Investigate QoS configurations that may be affecting traffic.

## Additional Resources
- Refer to the project documentation for detailed configuration examples.
- Utilize the validation scripts located in the `/scripts/test` directory to check configurations.
- Engage with the network engineering team for complex issues that require collaborative troubleshooting.

## Conclusion
Following these troubleshooting guidelines will help in efficiently diagnosing and resolving network issues. Always document any changes made during the troubleshooting process for future reference.
